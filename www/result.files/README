This directory contains the result files for the five benchmarking
data sets, as reported in Lahti et al. (in review; preprint available
at arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4639). Each R data file (see
http://r-project.org) corresponds to a specific benchmarking data set,
and contains a result list with the following elements:

auc: ROC/AUC scores for the comparison algorithms

roc: for each comparison algorithm, this element contains the ROC/AUC
score (auc) and the true positive rate (tpr) and false positive rate
(fpr) along the prioritized gene list.

runtime: running times for the comparison algorithms

ordered.genes: prioritized gene list for each comparison algorithm

cancerGenes: list of known cancer genes for this data set

available.methods: list of the comparison algorithm names
