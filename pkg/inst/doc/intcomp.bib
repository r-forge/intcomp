  abstract =	 {The integration of high-throughput genomic data
                  represents an opportunity for deciphering the
                  interplay between structural and functional
                  organization of genomes and for discovering novel
                  biomarkers. However, the development of integrative
                  approaches to complement gene expression (GE) data
                  with other types of gene information, such as copy
                  number (CN) and chromosomal localization, still
                  represents a computational challenge in the genomic
                  arena. This work presents a computational procedure
                  that directly integrates CN and GE profiles at
                  genome-wide level. When applied to DNA/RNA paired
                  data, this approach leads to the identification of
                  Significant Overlaps of Differentially Expressed and
                  Genomic Imbalanced Regions (SODEGIR). This goal is
                  accomplished in three steps. The first step extends
                  to CN a method for detecting regional imbalances in
                  GE. The second part provides the integration of CN
                  and GE data and identifies chromosomal regions with
                  concordantly altered genomic and transcriptional
                  status in a tumor sample. The last step elevates the
                  single-sample analysis to an entire dataset of tumor
                  specimens. When applied to study chromosomal
                  aberrations in a collection of astrocytoma and renal
                  carcinoma samples, the procedure proved to be
                  effective in identifying discrete chromosomal
                  regions of coordinated CN alterations and changes in
                  transcriptional levels.  },

abstract = {Genetic changes underlie tumor progression and may lead to cancer-specific expression of critical genes. Over 1100 publications have described the use of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to analyze the pattern of copy number alterations in cancer, but very few of the genes affected are known. Here, we performed high-resolution CGH analysis on cDNA microarrays in breast cancer and directly compared copy number and mRNA expression levels of 13,824 genes to quantitate the impact of genomic changes on gene expression. We identified and mapped the boundaries of 24 independent amplicons, ranging in size from 0.2 to 12 Mb. Throughout the genome, both high- and low-level copy number changes had a substantial impact on gene expression, with 44\% of the highly amplified genes showing overexpression and 10.5\% of the highly overexpressed genes being amplified. Statistical analysis with random permutation tests identified 270 genes whose expression levels across 14 samples were systematically attributable to gene amplification. These included most previously described amplified genes in breast cancer and many novel targets for genomic alterations, including the HOXB7 gene, the presence of which in a novel amplicon at 17q21.3 was validated in 10.2\% of primary breast cancers and associated with poor patient prognosis. In conclusion, CGH on cDNA microarrays revealed hundreds of novel genes whose overexpression is attributable to gene amplification. These genes may provide insights to the clonal evolution and progression of breast cancer and highlight promising therapeutic targets.

@article{Pollack2002,
abstract = {Genomic DNA copy number alterations are key genetic events in the development and progression of human cancers. Here we report a genome-wide microarray comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analysis of DNA copy number variation in a series of primary human breast tumors. We have profiled DNA copy number alteration across 6,691 mapped human genes, in 44 predominantly advanced, primary breast tumors and 10 breast cancer cell lines. While the overall patterns of DNA amplification and deletion corroborate previous cytogenetic studies, the high-resolution (gene-by-gene) mapping of amplicon boundaries and the quantitative analysis of amplicon shape provide significant improvement in the localization of candidate oncogenes. Parallel microarray measurements of mRNA levels reveal the remarkable degree to which variation in gene copy number contributes to variation in gene expression in tumor cells. Specifically, we find that 62\% of highly amplified genes show moderately or highly elevated expression, that DNA copy number influences gene expression across a wide range of DNA copy number alterations (deletion, low-, mid- and high-level amplification), that on average, a 2-fold change in DNA copy number is associated with a corresponding 1.5-fold change in mRNA levels, and that overall, at least 12\% of all the variation in gene expression among the breast tumors is directly attributable to underlying variation in gene copy number. These findings provide evidence that widespread DNA copy number alteration can lead directly to global deregulation of gene expression, which may contribute to the development or progression of cancer.},
